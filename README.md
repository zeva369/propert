# ProPert Project Management & monitoring

Propert allows to track any project by providing two different tools,
a Pert Chart, for detecting critical path and put the focus on critical tasks,
& a Gantt Chart, to know in real time the progress status of the project.
Additionally ProPert will include other kind of charts and diagrams like Kanban, 
but without compromising the main goal of ProPert which is to stay Easy, Baounded & Simple.
